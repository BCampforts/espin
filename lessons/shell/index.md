# Introduction to the shell

In this lesson we'll learn about the *shell*,
a command-based interface for interacting
with the operating system of a computer.

*Learning objectives:*

* Locate and open the terminal application on your computer
* Know what a file system is
* Understand basic shell coomands for manipulating files
* Get exposure to some intermediate/advanced commands
* Know where to get help, or more information

## Getting started

### Example files

Download example files.
Unpack them on your computer.

### Open a terminal

A terminal is an application that allows a user to communicate
with the operating system of a computer
through terse text commands.

* Linux: terminal
* macOS: Terminal.app (built-in) or [iTerm.app](https://www.iterm2.com/) (better)
* Windows: Git Bash Shell in [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)

At this time,
if you haven't already done so,
open a terminal on your computer.

### Why are we using a terminal instead of Finder or Windows Explorer?

When you develop skill with shell commands in a terminal,
you can do filesystem-specific tasks--moving, copying, renaming, deleting
files and directories--much faster than with a graphical application.

By analogy, think of keyboard shortcuts on your computer:
if you want to change from one application to another,
it's much faster to hit `Cmd-Tab` (on macOS; `Alt-Tab` on Linux and Windows)
than it is to use a mouse to go find the other application.

Commands tend to be terse to the point of being cryptic,
not that different from texting shorthand:
instead of brb, it's `cd`;
instead of irl, it's `rm`, etc.
And it's done for the same reason: speed.

### The command prompt
